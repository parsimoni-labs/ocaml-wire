   allocating: a hot read path validates a header then reads fields zero-copy,
   so a per-validate allocation here turns an O(log N) seek into O(N log N)

(* A compiled validator keeps a per-domain scratch, and the cost of reaching it
   on a domain that has not decoded yet must not track how many validators the
   program ever built. It used to: each validator minted its own
   [Domain.DLS.new_key], and a domain sizes its DLS array from the global key
   counter, so the first validate on a fresh domain paid about one word per key
   ever created. Measured here at 10,000 validators it was 32,792 words, and at
   50,000 it was 131,096, about 1 MB, charged to domains that never decode.

   [Gc.minor_words] cannot see this. The array is large enough to be allocated
   straight into the major heap, so read [Gc.allocated_bytes], which counts
   both. *)
